# Copilot Instructions for Paw & Tails Project

## Overview
This project is a web application for a veterinary service, focusing on pet adoption and care. The main components include HTML files for structure, CSS for styling, and images for visual content.

## Architecture
- **Main Files**: The primary files are `index.html`, `dogs.html`, and `cats.html`, which serve as the entry points for the application.
- **Styling**: The `styles.css` file contains all the styles for the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different pages.
- **Images**: The `images/`, `imagesCat/`, and `imagesDog/` directories store all visual assets used in the application.

## Developer Workflows
- **Building**: No specific build process is required as this is a static site. Simply open the HTML files in a browser to view.
- **Testing**: Manual testing is performed by navigating through the site in a web browser. Ensure all links and images load correctly.
- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools (F12) to inspect elements and debug CSS issues.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **HTML Structure**: Each HTML file follows a similar structure, with a header, navigation, and main content area. Ensure to maintain this structure for new pages.
- **CSS Classes**: Use descriptive class names in CSS for better readability and maintainability. For example, `.container-principal` is used for the main content area.

## Integration Points
- **External Links**: The application includes links to social media (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter) in the header. Ensure these links are updated as needed.
- **Navigation**: The navigation bar links to different sections of the site, including `dogs.html` and `cats.html`. Maintain consistency in navigation across all pages.
